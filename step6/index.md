# Overview
To join the program, you need a score of 90 or higher on the Duolingo English Practice Test, which is about CEFR level B1. We set this level because we’ve seen that it really helps with keeping up with the course materials — and most of all, we want to make sure everyone has the best chance to succeed. 
# What should you do? 
1. Preparation : 
- Find 50 minutes where you will not be interrupted.
- Register on the [Duolingo website](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/register) to do the Practice Test. There’s no need to purchase the official test ‼️
- You need to look at your camera during some exercises, so test that your camera and microphone are working. 
- You may need to do this test on your phone.
  
2. Take the test 
- Go to the Duolingo Practice Test page.
- Take the test, which will be around 45 minutes.
- Take a screenshot of your result.
  
3. Upload your result

Upload your screenshot in Step 6 on the HYF student portal. 

# How to check your work
