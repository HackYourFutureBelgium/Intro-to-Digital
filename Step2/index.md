# Overview
A cover letter is a short document that you send with your CV or job application. It‚Äôs your chance to introduce yourself, explain why you‚Äôre interested in the job, and to show how your skills and experience make you a good fit.

A well-written cover letter is important because it helps you stand out, shows your motivation, and gives employers a better sense of who you are beyond your CV. It can make a big difference in getting invited to an interview.

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can help with drafting these documents as long as you‚Äôre careful. Copying text from ChatGPT without reviewing it is a bad idea, as it tells lies. It‚Äôs especially important to be mindful of how you use it in an educational context. ChatGPT can make you think you‚Äôre progressing when you‚Äôre not. Copying straight from it won‚Äôt help you learn.

In this step, your goal is to use ChatGPT to help you prepare a cover letter for a fictional person named Jane Doe using the data we provide. You don‚Äôt need to understand the technical terms in the following pieces of text to complete the task.

# What Should You Do?
1. Sign up for a ChatGPT account : 

    Go to https://chatgpt.com and sign up for an account. The free version is all that‚Äôs needed ‚Äî no paid subscription required.

2. Ask the AI to help you write a cover letter

    Give it the description of Jane and the job description. Chat with the AI interactively as if it is a person. It may take some experimentation to get the right prompt. That‚Äôs OK - getting AI to do what you want is all about trial and error.

    ```üìù Note:``` Think about the goals of a cover letter. Read and reflect on the cover letter. Has the AI provided good links between Jane‚Äôs experience and the job‚Äôs requirements (e.g. does it note that she has experience in the legal sector)? How has the AI demonstrated that Jane has the right skills for the job? Has the AI added anything that wasn‚Äôt in the description of Jane? Could you do better?

    Think about your own future job hunt. What have you learned that will help you apply for jobs in the future? Will you use ChatGPT to help you generate a cover letter? If so, how will you make sure it‚Äôs a good cover letter? If not, why not?

3. Prepare the cover letter in a Google Doc: 

    Create a Google Doc and copy the cover letter text from ChatGPT into the Google Doc. Format the cover letter in the Google Doc.
