# Overview
CodePen is an easy-to-use website where you can build and preview simple web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîright in your browser‚Äîand easily share your work with others using a link.

In this exercise, you must build your own homepage on CodePen that meets some specific requirements. Give it your own personal touch. We know that people who do well on our courses show **creativity, curiosity, persistence**, and **rigour**. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for from you in this project.


# What should you do? 
1. Sign up for a free account on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).
2. Fork the CYF starter page
   
   Fork (make a copy of) the CYF starter page [Personal Home Page Template](https://codepen.io/IntroToTech/pen/PomeEod) to your own CodePen account.
    
   - Here are [the instructions to fork a CodePen page.](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/forks/)
   - Make sure you‚Äôre logged into CodePen when you fork the page. If you‚Äôre not logged in or if you don‚Äôt fork the pen, any changes you make are temporary and live only in the browser session. As soon as you refresh the page, close the browser tab, or leave the page, all your changes will be lost. so that your work is saved.

```‚ö†Ô∏è Note``` The template is set up to use JavaScript to check whether your HTML code passes 10 automated tests.
You must not modify the JavaScript code.

3. Prepare your homepage

    1. Prepare your homepage in the page you forked. 
    2. Write your HTML code in the HTML tab and your CSS code in the CSS tab. You may delete the HTML comment in the HTML tab.
    3. Your homepage must meet the following criteria, which are written in a special format called `Given/When/Then`.
   

<pre>Given a personal homepage,

When I look in the test console
Then all 10 tests are passing

When I read the content 
Then I learn something about you. 

When I view the page 
Then the design is unique and the images are displayed properly 

When I play the video on the page 
Then the video can play normally.

When I validate the HTML 
Then the HTML is valid. </pre>

4. Validate your code

    Use CodePen‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnalyze HTML‚Äù feature to help you find errors in your HTML code. Then fix the errors yourself manually. Use a similar approach to identify and fix CSS errors.

5. Submit your CodePen page link

    Submit your CodePen page link under Step 5 in the Canvas titled **Submit your tasks** in the `#intro-to-digital` channel.

`üí° Tip` Your work is not judged on aesthetics in this project. We are interested in code correctness and specification compliance.
