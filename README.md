## What is Intro to Digital and How does it work? 
When you sign up to study at HackYourFuture, your learning journey begins with the Intro to Digital (ITD) module. This is the first step into the world of tech at our school.

ITD is a flexible, self-paced module designed to fit around your schedule. It takes approximately 30 hours to complete. You will build your first websites using HTML, CSS, and block programming. You will explore how to use generative AI tools and learn to present data effectively with Google Sheets. You complete the module by following a sequence of tasks on our Student Portal. Each task you submit is reviewed by our volunteers, who provide feedback.

The ITD module opens for one month at a time and is then closed for one month before reopening. This cycle happens six times a year. Check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CJ5A93lbLPF4MAdTrxsW7Q83tSqUwLNt37PdoyeVCP8/edit?usp=sharing) for the calendar. 

During the months when ITD is active, we run weekly drop-in sessions on Sundays 12:00 to 16:00 where you can connect with other learners, support each other, or you can ask questions and receive guidance from HackYourFuture alumni about tasks, tools or technical challenges. You can get additional help through our Slack channel dedicated to ITD (#intro-to-digital).
